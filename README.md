<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
## Description

* Built with NodeJS, this simple app allows you to generate a README.md file based on your project's details and specifications. We worked on this to save time when spinning up new projects, and to serve as a base for future improvements and features to make our lives easier.

* This README file was generated with the app! See the /output folder for another example README.
